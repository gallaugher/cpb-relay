A Tutorial by Prof. John Gallaugher - @gallaugher

Two CircuitPython programs to use with a CircuitPlayground Bluefruit (CPB) &amp; Adafruit STEMMA Non-Latching Mini Relay. Find these products at:

- https://www.adafruit.com/product/4409

I'm also using a 3.5W LED lamp. Adafruit suggests projects that draw 60W or less power. Be sure you understand the risks of electrical work before working with the wiring of your lamp or similar appliance. Consult Adafruit's learn guide for more information: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stemma-non-latching-mini-relay The author assumes no responsibility for harm, damage, injury, or anything else resulting from your work. as always, make at your own risk, and build as an informed maker.

A video tutorial to accompany this example can be found as part of the Bluefruit School playlist at: https://bit.ly/bluefruit-school

This repo contains two CircuitPython programs. Run these one-at-a-time from a CircuitPlayground Bluefruit, making isure they're saved to the root directory, renaming the program as code.py

Also make sure your CPB has a "lib" folder with the following libraries:
- adafruit_ble
- adafruit_bluefruit_connect
- adafruit_bus_device
- adafruit_circuitplayground
- adafruit_led_animation
- adafruit_lis3dh.mpy
- adafruit_thermistor.mpy
- neopixel.mpy
- simpleio.mpy

If you build this, you can tweet to @gallaugher using the hashtag #BuiltWithProfG for a chance to win the weekly "Happy Gear: Make Something Awesome" laptop sticker.
